# Coding By Example

    Learn coding as a creative proccess with this guided tour through coding examples in C#, Python, and Rust.

## About the curiculumn

This is an open source coding curiculumn built around 3 core principlesm chosen based on the experiences of the curiculumns primary author both as a student and an instructor.

 1. **Don't lose sight of the big picture**    

    Often coding curiculumns over-focus on the syntax of a particular language. New students may struggle to learn what is common to programming as opposed to being a feature, quirck, or 'gotchya' of the particular language they are being taught. By providing content in 3 languages students can build an intuitive grounding of the difference between *syntax* and *programming*.

 2. **Teach by _lots of_ examples**

    Reading code can be as important a skill as writing it, especially for new programmers. In attempts to keep things simple curiculumns often skip over nuances and edge cases, which later can cause students lots of headaches. This curiculumn will strive to provide a large corpus of examples that can enable students to spot patterns and concepts by skimming and then learn about particulars by diving into particular cases.

3. **Demonstrate the creative process of coding**

    In the quest to keep things as simple as possible many courses skip over as much of the setup, planning, and "messiness" of real life programming. This can lead to students learning to program within the friendly and familiar sandboxes of their courses and then being lost when they need to create something outside of that sandbox. Additionally, curiculumns rarely focus at all on the "creative process" of coding, which is vital to exploratory learning. Lessons here will be designed to encourage iterative, exploratory learning by providing a range of tools for running and understanding code. These tools will include debugging, unit testing, and logging.
