# Coding By Example

This is an open source coding curiculumn built around 3 core principlesm chosen based on the experiences of the curiculumns primary author both as a student and an instructor.

 1. **Don't lose sight of the big picture**    

    Often coding curiculumns end up over-focusing on the syntax of a particular language. The effect is that new students don't learn what is common to programming as opposed to being a unique feature, quirck, or worse - 'gotchya', of the particular language they are being taught. By providing examples for all material in 3 languages students can start off right away with an intuitive grounding of the difference between *syntax* and *programming*.

 2. **Teach by _lots of_ examples**

    Reading code can be as important a skill as writing it, especially for new programmers. In attempts to keep things simple curiculumns often skip over nuances and edge cases, which later can cause students lots of headaches. By providing a large quantity of examples this curiculumn can enable students to spot patterns and concepts by skimming and then learn about particulars by diving into particular cases.

3. **Teach tools and workflow, not just coding**

    In the quest to keep things as simple as possible many courses skip over as much of the setup, planning, and "messiness" of real life programming. This can lead to students learning to program within the friendly and familiar sandboxes of their courses and then being lost when they need to create something outside of that sandbox. Additionally, curiculumns rarely focus at all on the "creative process" of coding, which is vital to exploratory learning.

## Using the Curiculumn

 The curiculumn is availble free of charge for both commercial and non commercial use (specifically it is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md) ).
