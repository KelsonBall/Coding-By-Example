The 'famous algorithms' section will implement as absurd-a-number-as-possible number of algorithms and data structures in each of the 3 languages. Many of these may be implemented multiple times, first as simply as possible, then using language specific techniques or enhancements that may be used in production code.

Todo:
 * Sorting
    * Bubblesort (of course)
    * Bogosort (again, of course)
    * Insertion sort
    * ♥ Merge ♥ sort ♥
    * Quicksort
    * Selection sort
    * Heap sort
    * Shell sort    
 * Search
    * Linear Search
    * Binary Search
 * Collections
    * Lists
    * Queues
        * Queue interface on a linked list
        * Circular buffers
    * Stacks
        * Stack interface on a linked list
        * 'Pointer into an array' stacks
        * Stack/Recursion direct comparisons
    * Trees
        * Binary Trees
        * Heaps
        * Self balancing trees
