# Welcome

This guide is intended for people already familiar with programming. For new students see the [self guided tour](./self-guided.md)

# Tools

You will need to install the following software to complete the lessons

 * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or [similar](https://www.slant.co/topics/12/~best-programming-text-editors)
 * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.6.5 or later)
 * [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (1.26 or later)
 * [dotnet core sdk](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/) (2.1 or later)

# Steps

 1. Fork and/or Download the curiculumn repository
    * if you intend on contributing, clone instead
    * for new git users, I recommend [git kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
 2. Start at the top
    
    The curriculumn is divided up into numbered chapters/sections/lessons. Most folders will have a 'Lesson.md' file or a '0_Info' folder containing many markdown (.md) files. To view rendered markdown files for easy reading you can open them in VS Code and press `Ctrl + shift + v` to open a markdown renderer.    

 3. Using the vs code integrated debugger

    TODO, learn how to use the integrated debugger and then teach about it here
